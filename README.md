started with a barebone with express with some existing functions,
frontend logic was rewritten for the project

User inputs do not get cleared upon sending a post request


***Wins & Challenges***<br>
wins:
all the functions work as in:

When a user hits ‘publish’, the post should be stored in a database and the client redirected to a show path

backend logic is the same as our previous projects

challenges:
